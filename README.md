This is a Full Stack Project for a basic To-Do List App with a simplistic looking UI. It has a Home Page, a Register Page for new users, a Login Page
for existing users and ofcourse, the to do list page. It has an add task field, a few filter buttons to view the tasks filtered. Each task has a checkbox,
and even an edit task and delete task button. There is a special button to clear all the completed tasks as well.

Here is the production link for the project:-
